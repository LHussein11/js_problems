# Objective
Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

# Hint
The problem can be solved using bitwise operators.

# Example Returns:
* findOdd([20,1,-1,2,-2,3,3,5,5,1,2,4,20,4,-1,-2,5]) will return **5**.
* findOdd([1,1,2,-2,5,2,4,4,-1,-2,5]) will return **-1**.
